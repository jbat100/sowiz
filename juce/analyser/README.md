Sound Analyser
==============

Sound Analyser is an audio plug-in for performing real-time audio analysis inside host applications such as Ableton Live or Logic Pro, and sending the result over Open Sound Control (OSC) so that the data can be used for sound-responsive applications. 

The driving motivation behind Sound Analyser is to allow anyone to quickly set up and experiment with different audio analysis algorithms. Some of the key benefits are:

* Use in multiple hosts (e.g. Ableton Live, Max, Logic Pro)
* No programming (on the audio analysis side)
* Multi-track audio analysis via multiple plug-in instances on different tracks
* Perform audio analysis on one computer and send the result to another, directly from the plug-in
* Preferences stored with the host application, and reloaded when you open your project

Sound Analyser is written and maintained by Adam Stark. The plug-in allows audio analysis algorithms from multiple authors to be implemented into the same framework, and acknowledges authorship within the GUI of the software for any third party algorithms.

Academic Papers
---------------

The Sound Analyser plug-in is described in the following paper:

* Adam M. Stark, "Sound Analyser: A Plug-In For Real-Time Audio Analysis In Live Performances And Installations", In Proceedings of New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME), London, 2014

Adding New Audio Algorithms To Sound Analyser
---------------------------------------------

Please extend the AudioAnalysis class in AudioAnalysis.h, and then add your new audio analysis in the function:

	void addAudioAnalysisAlgorithms();

found in:

AudioAnalysisManager.h

Version History
---------------

=== 1.0.1 === (27th July 2014)

* Fixed bug where Analyser Id was not saved
* Fixed bug where Mel-frequency spectrum did not reload the number of coefficients to send


=== 1.0.0 === (26th June 2014)

* The first version of Sound Analyser


Dependencies
------------

The plug-in depends on a number of libraries:

* JUCE ([http://www.juce.com/](http://www.juce.com/))
* Speex [just the resampling part] ([http://www.speex.org/](http://www.speex.org/))

And, for the FFT, either:

* FFTW ([http://fftw.org/](http://fftw.org/))

or

* Kiss FFT ([http://kissfft.sourceforge.net/](http://kissfft.sourceforge.net/))


Note on compiler flags:

* To use FFTW, add the flag -DUSE_FFTW
* To use KISS FFT add the flag -DUSE_KISS_FFT
* (Don't add them both together!)
